Snyk offers both a command-line tool and a Github integration that checks your application against Snykâ€™s open source vulnerability database for any known vulnerabilities in your dependencies. Install the CLI as follows:

$ npm install -g snyk
$ cd your-app
Use this command to test your application for vulnerabilities:

$ snyk test
Use this command to open a wizard that walks you through the process of applying updates or patches to fix the vulnerabilities that were found:

$ snyk wizard
